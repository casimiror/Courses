# Project Overview

## Purpose & Goals
The Courses project is a collection of learning materials, exercises, and implementations focused on various programming technologies and frameworks. It serves as a repository of knowledge and practical examples for learning different technologies.

## Key Features
- Machine Learning with PyTorch implementation examples
- Neo4j graph database examples
- Rust programming language examples
- Structured learning materials organized by technology and topic

## Technology Stack
- Python with PyTorch for machine learning and deep learning
- Neo4j for graph database examples
- Rust for systems programming
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning and experimentation

## Project Scope
[Define what is in scope and out of scope for this project]

## Stakeholders
[List key stakeholders and their roles]

## Timeline
[Major milestones and deadlines]

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by technology and topic:

- `memory-bank/`: Documentation and project knowledge
- `PyTorch/`: Deep learning implementations with PyTorch
  - `chapter_1_basics/`: Fundamental PyTorch concepts and implementations
  - `chapter_2_sequences/`: Sequence modeling with PyTorch
- `Neo4j/`: Graph database examples and queries
- `Rust/`: Rust programming examples and projects
  - `deck/`: A card deck implementation in Rust

# Architecture

## System Architecture
The Courses project is a collection of independent learning modules with examples and implementations for different technologies. It follows a modular architecture where each technology has its own directory and implementation approach:

- PyTorch implementations follow machine learning project structures with notebooks
- Neo4j examples consist of Cypher query files
- Rust implementations follow standard Cargo project structure

## Design Patterns
- **Modular organization**: Each technology is separated into its own directory
- **Progressive complexity**: PyTorch examples are organized from basic to more advanced concepts
- **Notebook-based learning**: Interactive notebooks for data science and machine learning concepts
- **Implementation examples**: Practical code samples for learning purposes

## Technical Decisions
- Using Jupyter notebooks for PyTorch examples to allow for interactive learning and visualization
- Organizing PyTorch content by chapters to create a structured learning path
- Using standard Cargo project structure for Rust examples to follow best practices
- Using Cypher files for Neo4j examples for direct database interaction

## Data Flow
### PyTorch Sequence Models
1. Data generation/preparation: Creating synthetic time series data
2. Model definition: Creating PyTorch models for prediction
3. Training loop: Optimizing model parameters
4. Evaluation: Comparing model predictions with targets

## Architecture Diagrams
No formal architecture diagrams are currently defined as the project is a collection of independent learning modules rather than an integrated system.
